# Demo of metajelo in action

[metajelo](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/metajelo) is being developed to have richer metadata on linked objects associated with articles, with just-enough information. 

This mini website demonstrates how metajelo can work. It is available at [https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/metajelo-demo/](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/metajelo-demo/).

[index.html](index.html) is a simple mockup.

[metajelo-demo.html] is yet to come.
